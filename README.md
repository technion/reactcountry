# ReactCountry

Demo React application. This is probably of no value to you.

# Technologies

- React
- Easy-peasy state management
- BlueprintJS UI framework

# Deployed code

You can see this demo in production here:

https://boring-goldwasser-034663.netlify.com/

# Development Commands

```
npm run start: Starts a dev server with hot reload on http://localhost:8080
npm run dev: Builds dev mode environment
npm run prod: Builds prod mode environment
npm run analyse: Builds a prod mode environment and also outputs a bundle size report
npm run lint: Runs linting service
```

# Browser support

This application does not bundle polyfills or transpile ES6 and requires a modern browser. Chrome and Edge have been tested, IE11 is known to not work. A feature test will alert a user where a browser is unsupported.

# TODOs

Several remaining issues are documented here:

# Variations

The countries API does not return the wikipedia page link, so it is not included.
